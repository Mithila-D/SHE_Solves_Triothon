Our AI-powered hostel security system enhances safety through automated monitoring with computer vision, visitor tracking, and real-time alerts. It detects unauthorized entries, verifies visitors, and instantly notifies parents for added security.

Additionally, two AI chatbots are available for girl students to chat withâ€”offering safety tips, mental health support, and a private space to express their thoughts. The system utilizes sentiment analysis with deep learning and natural language processing to continuously improve user experience, by doing 'sentiment analysis', an AI-ML application

Built with React, Node.js, Django, MySQL, YOLOv8, and OpenCV, our solution ensures a smarter, safer, and more supportive hostel environment.
